# before reading or writing a file, you need to open it
fileobject = open(filename, mode)     # mode is just the file's type and what you want to do with it

# modes
# r is for read
# w is for write. If the file doesn't exist, it's created. If it does exist, it's  overwritten. a
# x means write, but only if the file does NOT already exist
