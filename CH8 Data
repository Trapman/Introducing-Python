# before reading or writing a file, you need to open it
fileobject = open(filename, mode)     # mode is just the file's type and what you want to do with it

# the first letter of the mode in open() is for the operation:
# r is for read
# w is for write. If the file doesn't exist, it's created. If it does exist, it's  overwritten. a
# x means write, but only if the file does NOT already exist
 
# the second letter is for the file's type: 
# t (or just leaving it blank) is for text
# b is for binary

# write a text file with write()
lyrics = '''What was it like to see,
The face of your own stability,
Suddenly walk away,
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless.'''

# write the entire set of lyrics to the file 'jimmy' in one call:
tool = open('jimmy', 'w')
tool.write(lyrics)
tool.close()
# write() returns the # of bytes written, and adds NO spaces or new lines: print() does though

# you can also print() to a text file:
tool = open('jimmy', 'w')
print(lyrics, file = tool)
tool.close()

# print() uses default new spaces and lines unless you tell it not to:
tool = open('jimmy', 'w')
print(lyrics, file = tool, sep='', end='')
tool.close()

# prevent overwriting a file by using MODE X:
tool = open('jimmy', 'x')

# build MODE X into an exception
try:
    tool = open('jimmy', 'x')
    tool.write('stomp stomp stomp')
except FileExistsError:
    print('jimmy already exists! You almost overwrote it!!')
