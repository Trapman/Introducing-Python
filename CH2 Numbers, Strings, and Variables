# Main Types of Objects Covered here:
#booleans
#integers
#floats
#strings

# everything in Python is implemented as an object.
# the type of object determines if it's mutable or immutable

type()  
# if you want to know the type of anything (literal value, variable, etc.)

# Numbers: simple math operators incuding
+
-
*
/     # floating point division:  7 / 2 returns 3.5
//    # integer truncating division:  7 // 2 returms 3
%     # modulus (remainder):        7 % 3 returns 1
**    # exponential:                3**4 returns 81 

# combining operators
-=    # so a-= 3 is the same thing as saying a = a- 3
*=    # so a*=3 is the same thing as saying a = a * 3
a /=  # so a/=3 is the same thing as sayin a = a / 3

# ex: a = 10, a-=2, a becomes 8

# Type Conversions: 
int()   # changes other Python data types to an integer: int(99.5) returns 99
        # use on strings too: int('99') returns 99
 
float()  # changes to float, so float(99) returns 99.0

str()   #changes to a string, so str(99) returns '99'

#Escape Characters: use \
\n  #returns a new line
\t  #returns a new tab

# combine strings with +   : "Good evening" + "how are you, Trapman?" returns "Good evening how are you, Trapman?"

# Slicing: use []
[ start : end : step] format
[:] extracts everthing
[start :] specifies the start to the end
[: end]   specifies from the beginning to the end (up to but not including)
[start : end]
[start : end : step] specifies from the begining to the end, skipping characters by step
